    Description:
    A population of swarm consists of two groups of bees:
        -scout bees 20%
        -accumulators 80%
    The goal for scout is to get bees to a location predefined on the scouts
    The goal for accumulators is to obtain the best possible location from scouts
    the reward is computed jointly for scouts and accumulators:
    reward = alpha * num of swarm reach consensus + beta * the quality of location of
    the majority selected hive.
    scouts:
        -movements 
        -utterances
        -predefined hive info
    accumulators:
        -movements
        -utterances

        -num_agents (scalar)
        -num_landmarks (scalar)
